Personal Empowerment: Technology empowers individuals by providing tools and resources for self-expression, creativity, and personal development. 
bject-oriented: C++ is an object-oriented programming language. This means that the focus is on “objects” and manipulations around these objects. 
Information about how these manipulations work is abstracted out from the consumer of the object. 
Rich library support: Through C++ Standard Template Library (STL) many functions are available that help in quickly writing code. 
For instance there are standard libraries for various containers like sets, maps, hash tables, etc. 
Speed: C++ is the preferred choice when latency is a critical metric. 
The compilation, as well as the execution time of a C++ program, is much faster than most other general purpose programming languages. 
Compiled: A C++ code has to be first compiled into low-level code and then executed, unlike interpreted programming languages where no compilation is needed. 
Pointer Support: C++ also supports pointers which are widely used in programming and are often not available in several programming languages.
